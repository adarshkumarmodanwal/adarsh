                    for valuable resources and help from Sarkari Result.

                    Did you know that over 1.5 million people lost their jobs in August 2021 in rural and urban India?
                    Yes, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the job market hard. Small businesses and multinationals alike
                    have had to reconsider their staffing requirements.


                    Are you an unemployed Indian citizen because of the pandemic and fluctuating job market?


                    Are you working for a multinational company going through restructuring and considering your next
                    steps?

                    Are you a recent graduate looking to find your first job?

                    Are you wondering if a government job is right for you?

                    You've come to the right place! At Sarkari Result, we will show you the benefits of an Indian
                    government job and help you to find a government job that's stable, long-term, and right for you!
                    In India, a Sarkari Naukri (or an Indian government job) is highly sought-after. It's the ultimate
                    career goal, offering long-term security, good benefits, and friendly co-workers.

                    More than that, an Indian government job offers an opportunity to live a life of purpose.

                    It's a way for you to give back to your community.

                    According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), the unemployment rate in
                    India increased from 6.5% in November 2020 to 7.75% in October 2021. In this fluctuating market,
                    there has been an increase in the demand for the stability and permanence offered by a Sarkari
                    Naukri.

                    In addition, government jobs in India can be pretty lucrative offering competitive salaries,
                    benefits, and pensions. Some of the highest-paid jobs in the Indian government include the Indian
                    Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Foreign Services (IFS), and Indian Police Services (IPS).


                    Keep in mind that these jobs are also highly competitive with a complex application process!

                    Indian government can range from policy-making, public administration, military, law, engineering,
                    and even teaching. Some of the more highly-paid and in-demand positions are discussed below to give
                    you a sense of their requirements and salary expectations.

                    1. Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and Indian Foreign Services (IFS) Jobs : The role of an IAS
                    officer may include advising the ministers on various policy issues, implementing policies of the
                    government, collecting revenue, and supervising public spending. An IFS officer manages foreign
                    relations in India with more than 160 Indian Diplomatic Missions and International Organizations
                    around the world. The starting monthly salary of an IAS or IFS officer is about INR 56,100.


                    2. Indian Police Services (IPS) Jobs : A role with the IPS involves safeguarding the public,

                    additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about INR 57,000 including
                    allowances.
